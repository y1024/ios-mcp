# iOS MCP

[中文](README.md) | English

iOS MCP is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that runs on jailbroken iPhones, enabling AI agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.) to directly control iOS devices.

## Runtime Requirements

- Jailbroken iOS device

## Installation

### Supported Environments

| Jailbreak Type | Supported iOS Versions | Package Architecture |
|------|------|------|
| `rootful` | iOS 13 - iOS 18 | `iphoneos-arm` |
| `rootless` | iOS 15 - iOS 18 | `iphoneos-arm64` |
| `roothide` | iOS 15 - iOS 18 | `iphoneos-arm64e` |

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Download a package from the Release page

Choose the `.deb` package that matches the architecture listed in the table above.

For manual installation, make sure these dependencies are present:

- `mobilesubstrate/ElleKit`
- `preferenceloader`

#### Method 2: Install directly from Cydia / Sileo

You can also search and install directly from:

- `Cydia`
- `Sileo`

Package name:

- `iOS MCP`

### Recommended checks after installation

1. Restart `SpringBoard`
2. Open the following URL in a browser:

```text
http://DEVICE_IP:8090/health
```

3. If you get the following response, the service is running correctly:

```json
{"status":"ok","server":"ios-mcp","version":"1.1.2"}
```

## Usage

After installation, open **Settings** → **iOS MCP** on your device. Start the server, then tap "Copy MCP Prompt Snippet" and paste it into your AI agent's prompt.

To download large or binary files from the device, access the HTTP endpoint directly to avoid base64 truncation:

```bash
curl 'http://device-ip:8090/download_file?path=/var/mobile/...' -o output.bin
```

## Security Notes

- The MCP server has no built-in authentication — it is recommended to use it only on local networks
- When the device is locked or the screen is off, the server blocks interactive/mutating tools such as tap, swipe, text input, app launch, and shell commands; observation, screenshot, and wake/recovery tools remain allowed
- The `run_command` tool can execute arbitrary shell commands — use with caution
- `read_file` / `write_file` / `download_file` can read and write device paths within the MCP server process's permission scope, at the same risk level as `run_command` — use only on trusted networks
- `get_syslog` reads the live system-wide log of all apps via `mcp-logreader` (signed with the `com.apple.private.logging.stream` entitlement), which may contain sensitive data — use only on trusted networks
- `mcp-root` provides root privilege elevation, intended for internal use only
